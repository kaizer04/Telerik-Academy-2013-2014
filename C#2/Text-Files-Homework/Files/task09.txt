SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Windows PowerShell supports the following arithmetic operators:
              times.
        +, - (for subtraction)
        C:\PS> (3+3)/ (1+1)

    the operation fails.
    You can also perform arithmetic operations on objects of different types. 
        C:\PS> $array = 1,2,3
    Because the method that is used to evaluate statements is determined by the
        C:\PS> "file" * 3

        You can add another hash table only to a hash table.
        C:\PS> $array + $hash1
        C:\PS> $sum[3]
        b                              2

        file
        Name                           Value

        C:\PS> (512MB * 512MB).GetType().FullName
    results.
        C:\PS> $intB = 4 
    strings, and arrays. However, you can also use arithmetic operators with 
	C:\PS> get-process | where {($_.ws * 2) -gt 50mb}
	2 


	C:\PS> $servers = @{0 = "LocalHost"; 1 = "Server01"; 2 = "Server02"} 
	C:\PS> $servers += @{3 = "Server03"} #Use assignment operator 
    about_variables
              arrays, and hash tables.                "file" + "name"


    appropriate to the .NET Framework type of the first object. If it fails to
